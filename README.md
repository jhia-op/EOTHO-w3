# Eat Out to Help Out (EOTHO)
Eat Out to Help Out was a scheme launched by the UK government to encourage people to support local businesses during the pandemic. F&B outlets who signed up to the scheme would give a 50% discount on their prices to customers with the support of government funding. The F&B outlets who signed up to this scheme was made publicly available. 

This project uses location data and creates an interactive map to enable users to search for participating restaurants in the vicinity of a postcode. It covers outlets in London only.
